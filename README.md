# M3G8

For this project I decided to redesign http://www.litliithrottaskolinn.is/. It sure needs it!
I wanted to make a bright and slightly playful design since Litli íþróttaskólinn is for kids, but also let the design breathe and make the information clear for the parents who are navigating this site.

I chose a three color palette, with the blue being the primary color, the yellow for good contrast and green for accent. 
I made a simple new logo for them and only used one font, in different weights, for everything apart from the logo.
I tried to make sure there is plenty of white space and that the spacing between elements looks good.
